# Timer
<br>
A simple timer app can be crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In HTML, structure the interface with divs for timer display and buttons for controls. CSS styles beautify the layout, adjusting fonts, colors, and positioning. JavaScript powers the functionality, initializing the timer, handling button clicks, and updating the display dynamically. Use setInterval() to increment time and clearInterval() to stop it. Implement start, pause, reset functionalities with corresponding event listeners. Utilize DOM manipulation to update timer values. CSS animations can enhance user experience, like highlighting active buttons. This trio of technologies synergizes to create a sleek, responsive timer app for various purposes.
